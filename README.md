Tired of manually creating backend boilerplate every time you build a frontend? **`create-backlist`** is an intelligent CLI tool that analyzes your frontend project and automatically generates a backend with all the necessary routes and controllers, saving you hours of repetitive work.

It's not just another scaffolder; it's a **context-aware, dynamic code generator** that builds a backend tailor-made for your frontend's specific API needs.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **ü§ñ Intelligent Code Analysis:** Scans your frontend codebase (React, Vue, etc.) using Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) to detect API calls (`fetch` requests).
-   **üåê Multi-Language Support:** Generate a backend in your preferred stack. Currently supports:
    -   Node.js (with TypeScript & Express)
    -   C# (with ASP.NET Core Web API)
-   **‚ö°Ô∏è Fully Automated:** A single command handles everything from project scaffolding to dependency installation.
-   **üîß Zero-Configuration:** No complex config files needed. Just run the command and answer a few simple questions.
-   ** clean Code Generation:** Creates a well-structured backend, ready for you to implement your business logic.

## üì¶ Installation & Usage

No global installation needed! Just run this command inside your existing frontend project's root directory:

```bash
npm create backlist@latest
```

The tool will then guide you through an interactive setup process:

1.  **Enter a name for your backend directory:** (default: `backend`)
2.  **Select the backend stack:** (e.g., `Node.js (TypeScript, Express)`)
3.  **Enter the path to your frontend `src` directory:** (default: `src`)

That's it! The tool will analyze your code, generate the backend in a new directory, and install all the necessary dependencies.

### Example

Let's say your frontend has this API call:

```javascript
// in your React component
fetch('/api/products/123', { method: 'PUT' });
```

`create-backlist` will automatically generate a backend with a `products` controller and a `PUT` route for `products/:id`.

## üí° How It's Different from Other Tools

| Tool                  | Approach                               | Use Case                                                    |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Express Generator** | Static Scaffolding                     | Quickly start a *new, empty* Express project.               |
| **NestJS CLI**        | Static Scaffolding & Code Generation | Start a *new, structured* NestJS project and add parts manually. |
| **`create-backlist`** | **Dynamic & Context-Aware Scaffolding** | Generate a backend that is **tailor-made** for an *existing* frontend. |

While traditional generators give you a blank canvas, `create-backlist` looks at your finished painting (the frontend) and builds the perfect frame (the backend) for it.
